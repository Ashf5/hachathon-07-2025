Asher,

Your Hackathon project looks great!
You incorporated all of the topics we covered in class — great job!

Your code is clean, readable, and well-structured — well done.
I noticed you included comments to explain parts of your code, which is great. You can definitely add a few more to make it even more understandable.

For next time, try to manage your time in a way that allows you to also focus on the UI. Remember that the visual presentation is the **first impression** for anyone you're presenting to.

Keep up the great work!
